  <p>
    A guy who loves games to a point where to play them is not enough.
    So as a hobby, while some people write novels, others play music or do sports, I make games.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Brazil, where I live, game development is not widely known as a real job.
    There are few offers on the area, almost none with reliable opportunities.
    Currently I work as a Web Application Programmer and, although it's not gaming related, it pays the bills.
  </p>
  <p>
    After graduating on Systems Analysis I got a 2 year course on game development where a could learn from awesome teachers and professionals.
    Some of them had games published worldwide, reaching moderate success.
    During the studies I learned many things, applicable both inside and outside of a game development scenario.
    Quoting Einstein: <em>"As our circle of knowledge expands, so it does the circumference of darkness surrounding it."</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a place where I'll try to share what I've learned and try not to forget them myself.
    Bear with me that most of what I write is based on my own learning experiences and I'm just passionately curious about lots of things.
