<p class="lead">Who am I?</p>

<p>
  I'm a guy who loves games, all of them, to a point where playing them was not enough, I had to create them.
  And I do that for fun, as a (very nerdy) hobby. Some people write, some people play music. I try to make games.
</p>
<p>
  I live in Brazil, where game development is not widely known and not seen as a real job.
  Very few places offer jobs on the area and almost none of them offer decent or reliable oportunities.
  Currently I work as a programmer (always a programmer at heart) developing web applications that are not nearly related to games, but I have bills to pay, you know...
</p>
<p>
  After undergraduating on a course of Systems Analysis, I took 2 years of formal education on game development with awesome teachers and professionals.
  Some of them created and published games here in Brazil and worldwide, reaching small to moderate success.
</p>
<p>
  During my studies I think I've learned a lot of things, some of them are perfectly appliable both inside and outside of a game development scenario.
  Like Einstein said: <em>"As our circle of knowlege expands, so it does the circumference of darkness surrounding it."</em>
</p>
<p>
  This is a place where I try to share what I've learned and try not to forget them myself.
  I do not know everything or assume someone does, and I might post things that after a while are proven imprecise, incorrect or un-optimized, but I'll try to fix and clarify those as soon as possible, with help of you out there.
</p>
<p>Bear with me that most of what I write is based on my learning experiences and I'm just passionately curious about lots of things.</p>
