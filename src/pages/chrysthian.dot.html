<p class="lead">Who am I?</p>

<p>I'm a guy who loves games, all of them, to a point that playing them all the time was not enough, I had to CREATE them.</p>
<p>I do that for fun, as a (VERY nerd) hobby, some people write, some people play music, I'm trying to make my games.</p>
<p>I live in Brazil, where most of game development scenario is not known widely and not seen as a "real" job.</p>
<p>Very few places offer jobs on game development here, almost none present some decent, reliable oportunities.</p>
<p>Currently I work as a programmer (and always were a programmer at heart) developing web applications that are not nearly related to games, but I have bills to pay you know...</p>
<p>After graduating on a course of Systems Analysis, I had a formal education on game development during 2 years with awesome teachers and professionals. Some of them created and published games here in Brazil and/or worldwide, with a small to moderate success.</p>
<p>During my studies I think I've learned a LOT of things, some of them are perfectly appliable both inside and outside of game development scenario.</p>
<p>Like Einstein said: <i>"As our circle of knowlege expands, so it does the circumference of darkness surrounding it"</i>.</p>
<p>This is a place where I try to share what I've learned with others and try not to forget them myself.</p>
<p>I do not know everything or assume someone does, and I might post things that after a while are proven imprecise, incorrect and/or un-optimized, but I'll try to fix and clarify those as soon as possible, with help of you out there.</p>
<p>Bear with me that most of what I write is based on my learning experiences and I'm just passionately curious about lots of things.</p>
