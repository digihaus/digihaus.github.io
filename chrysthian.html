  <p class="lead">Who am I?</p>
  <p>
    I'm a guy who loves games, all of them, to a point where playing them was not enough, I had to create them.
    And I do that for fun, as a (very nerdy) hobby. Some people write, some people play music. I try to make games.
  </p>
  <p>
    I live in Brazil, where game development is not widely known and not seen as a real job.
    Very few places offer jobs on the area and almost none of them offer decent or reliable oportunities.
    Currently I work as a programmer (always a programmer at heart) developing web applications that are not nearly related to games, but I have bills to pay, you know...
  </p>
  <p>
    After undergraduating on a course of Systems Analysis, I took 2 years of formal education on game development with awesome teachers and professionals.
    Some of them created and published games here in Brazil and worldwide, reaching small to moderate success.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my studies I think I've learned a lot of things, some of them are perfectly appliable both inside and outside of a game development scenario.
    Like Einstein said: <em>"As our circle of knowlege expands, so it does the circumference of darkness surrounding it."</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a place where I try to share what I've learned and try not to forget them myself.
    I do not know everything or assume someone does, and I might post things that after a while are proven imprecise, incorrect or un-optimized, but I'll try to fix and clarify those as soon as possible, with help of you out there.
  </p>
  <p>Bear with me that most of what I write is based on my learning experiences and I'm just passionately curious about lots of things.</p>
